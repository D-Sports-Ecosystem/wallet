# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for adding comprehensive documentation and docstrings to the @d-sports/wallet project. The goal is to improve code maintainability, developer onboarding, and overall code quality by ensuring all key files have proper documentation. This includes JSDoc-style comments for functions, classes, interfaces, and other code elements, as well as explanatory comments for complex logic.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on the @d-sports/wallet project, I want all code files to have comprehensive documentation so that I can understand their purpose, usage, and implementation details quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining any file in the project THEN the file SHALL have a header comment explaining its purpose and role in the system
2. WHEN looking at a class, function, or interface THEN it SHALL have JSDoc-style documentation explaining its purpose, parameters, return values, and usage examples where appropriate
3. WHEN encountering complex logic or algorithms THEN they SHALL have inline comments explaining the approach and reasoning
4. WHEN viewing exported APIs THEN they SHALL have comprehensive documentation including usage examples

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a new developer joining the @d-sports/wallet project, I want consistent documentation standards across all files so that I can quickly understand the codebase regardless of which part I'm working on.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing documentation across different files THEN the documentation style and format SHALL be consistent
2. WHEN examining JSDoc comments THEN they SHALL follow a consistent structure with @param, @returns, @example, and other appropriate tags
3. WHEN looking at file headers THEN they SHALL consistently include information such as file purpose, author, version, and last modified date
4. WHEN viewing documentation for similar components or functions THEN the documentation structure SHALL be consistent across all instances

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer using the @d-sports/wallet library, I want comprehensive API documentation so that I can effectively integrate and use the library in my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining public API functions and classes THEN they SHALL have detailed documentation including usage examples
2. WHEN looking at function parameters THEN they SHALL have clear descriptions of their purpose, type, and any constraints
3. WHEN viewing return values THEN they SHALL have clear documentation of their structure and meaning
4. WHEN encountering error conditions THEN they SHALL have documentation on possible errors and how to handle them

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a maintainer of the @d-sports/wallet project, I want documentation that explains the architecture and design decisions so that future changes can be made consistently with the original design intent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining key architectural components THEN they SHALL have documentation explaining their design philosophy and patterns used
2. WHEN looking at integration points between components THEN they SHALL have documentation explaining the contracts and expectations
3. WHEN viewing platform-specific code THEN it SHALL have documentation explaining the platform differences and considerations
4. WHEN examining configuration options THEN they SHALL have documentation explaining their impact and recommended values

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer working on the UI components of @d-sports/wallet, I want comprehensive documentation of component props, state management, and rendering behavior so that I can effectively use and extend these components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining UI components THEN they SHALL have documentation for all props including type, purpose, default values, and examples
2. WHEN looking at component state management THEN it SHALL have documentation explaining the state structure and transitions
3. WHEN viewing component rendering logic THEN it SHALL have documentation explaining conditional rendering and styling approaches
4. WHEN examining component lifecycle methods THEN they SHALL have documentation explaining their purpose and side effects
