# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The D-Sports wallet package currently has browser compatibility issues due to Node.js specific imports and dependencies being included in the browser bundle. This prevents the package from being used in browser environments, limiting its usability for web applications. The package needs to be refactored to properly separate server-side and client-side code, ensuring that Node.js modules are excluded from browser bundles while maintaining full functionality across all supported platforms (web, Next.js, and React Native).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want to use the D-Sports wallet UI components in my browser-based application, so that I can provide wallet functionality without encountering Node.js module errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the package is imported in a browser environment THEN it SHALL NOT include Node.js specific modules like `fs`, `path`, or `crypto`
2. WHEN the package is built for browser use THEN it SHALL use browser-compatible alternatives for all platform-specific functionality
3. WHEN the package is used in a web application THEN it SHALL function without requiring Node.js polyfills

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a package maintainer, I want to separate server-side utilities from client-side components, so that browser bundles only include necessary code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the package THEN server-side utilities SHALL be excluded from browser bundles
2. WHEN platform-specific code is needed THEN it SHALL use conditional imports or dynamic loading
3. WHEN the package is built THEN it SHALL generate separate bundles for different environments (browser, Node.js, React Native)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the package to maintain full functionality across all platforms, so that I can use the same API regardless of the target environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the package in any supported platform THEN all core wallet functionality SHALL work correctly
2. WHEN platform-specific features are unavailable THEN the package SHALL provide graceful fallbacks
3. WHEN the package is used across different platforms THEN the API SHALL remain consistent

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a build system, I want to properly resolve platform-specific dependencies, so that only relevant code is included in each bundle.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building for web THEN Node.js dependencies SHALL be excluded from the bundle
2. WHEN building for React Native THEN web-specific dependencies SHALL be excluded from the bundle
3. WHEN building for Next.js THEN both client and server capabilities SHALL be available as appropriate
