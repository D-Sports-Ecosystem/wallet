# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical build issues in the @d-sports/wallet package that are causing TypeScript errors and warnings during the build process. The main issues include missing token data imports, unused TypeScript directives, and import path resolution problems that need to be resolved to ensure clean builds across all platforms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer building the wallet package, I want all TypeScript compilation errors to be resolved so that the build process completes without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL NOT produce any TypeScript compilation errors
2. WHEN importing token data THEN the system SHALL resolve the import path correctly from the src directory
3. WHEN the build completes THEN all generated files SHALL be valid and functional

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want unused TypeScript directives to be cleaned up so that the build output is clean and warnings are minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript processes the button component THEN the system SHALL NOT show unused @ts-expect-error directive warnings
2. WHEN the cn utility import is processed THEN the system SHALL import correctly without requiring error suppression
3. WHEN the build runs THEN unnecessary TypeScript directives SHALL be removed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working with the wallet modal, I want the token data to be properly accessible from the src directory so that the component can import and use token information correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the wallet modal imports token data THEN the system SHALL resolve the import from the correct src directory path
2. WHEN token data is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide the availableTokens and tokens exports
3. WHEN the component renders THEN token data SHALL be available for display and interaction
